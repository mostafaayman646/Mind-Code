# **Mind Code: Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer‚Äôs Using PDEs and Machine Learning**

## **Overview**  
Mind Code is a research project focused on advancing the early diagnosis of **Alzheimer‚Äôs disease** by integrating **partial differential equations (PDEs)**, **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**, and **symbolic regression**. This project explores tau protein diffusion in the brain, aiming to predict the reaction term in the reaction-diffusion PDE that governs its behavior.

Through this interdisciplinary approach, we aim to contribute to **healthcare innovation** by providing tools for better understanding Alzheimer‚Äôs progression and enhancing diagnostic precision.

## **How It Works**
### 1. **Preprocessing**
- **PET Scan Denoising**: Applied the **heat equation** to denoise PET scans before classification.
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Created synthetic data for training using four different reaction equations.

### 2. **Training and Prediction**
- Trained **PINNs** to predict the unknown reaction term in the reaction-diffusion PDE.
- Used **symbolic regression** to derive interpretable reaction equations.

### 3. **Simulation**
- Simulated tau protein diffusion in a 2D brain-like shape using **COMSOL**.
- Applied the predicted reaction term to visualize diffusion patterns.

### 4. **Visualization**
- Developed an interactive webpage to dynamically present results and insights.
