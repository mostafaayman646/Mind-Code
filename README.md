# *PINN for solving PDE and Its application in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease**

## **Overview** 
Its a research project focused on advancing the early diagnosis of **Alzheimer‚Äôs disease** by integrating **partial differential equations (PDEs)**, **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**, and **symbolic regression**. This project explores tau protein diffusion in the brain, aiming to predict the reaction term in the reaction-diffusion PDE that governs its behavior.
Through this interdisciplinary approach, we aim to contribute to **healthcare innovation** by providing tools for better understanding Alzheimer‚Äôs progression and enhancing diagnostic precision.

The equation is given as:

$$
\frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot (D \cdot \nabla c) + f(c)
$$

Where:
- \(c\): Concentration
- \(D\): Diffusion coefficient (tensor or scalar)
- \(f(c)\): Reaction term
